    <h1>Day 6 JavaScript + DOM Project Part 1</h1>
    <p>Today's course focused on JavaScript and DOM manipulation (Project Part 1). 
        I learned how to use JavaScript to select HTML elements and change their content and style. 
        This helped me understand how webpages become interactive. 
        The session was helpful for building a strong foundation in front-end development.
