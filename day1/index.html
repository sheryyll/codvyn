    <h1>Day 1</h1>

    <p>I want to learn web development because I see so many people around me getting into it, and it made me realize
        how important it is. I don't want to feel left behind, and I genuinely want to improve my skills and grow along
        with others. Learning web development feels like a practical step toward becoming more confident and staying
        relevant in the tech space.</p>
